# X.509-Attacker
X.509-Attacker is a tool based on ASN.1 Tool for creating arbitrary certificates; including especially invalid and malformed certificates. Since X.509 certificates encode their contents in ASN.1, this tool extends the features of ASN.1 Tool (https://github.com/RUB-NDS/ASN.1-Tool) in terms of certificate signing. Also, X.509-Attacker introduces a feature of referencing XML elements in order to avoid redundancies when defining certificates in XML.

# Acknowledgements
The framework was initially developed by Nils Kafka (nils.kafka@ruhr-uni-bochum.de) during his master thesis. 

# Projects
This framework is used in future versions of TLS-Attacker (https://github.com/RUB-NDS/TLS-Attacker)
